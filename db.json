      "description": "There exists a world in which islands of all shapes and sizes float in a sea of clouds. This is a world forsaken by the gods.\nA long time ago, beings known as the Astrals attempted to seize control of this world with their overwhelming power. However, the citizens of the skies, the Skydwellers, successfully resisted. The world once again entered a time of peace.\nPresently, our hero is about to embark on a journey after receiving a letter from his missing father. Accompanying him is Vyrn, a rather peculiar family member who happens to be a winged lizard. Despite Vyrn's objections, our hero prepares to leave his home of Zinkenstill when the mysterious island is suddenly engulfed in flames.\nThe fleet of the burgeoning Erste Empire wreaks havoc from the skies above.\nAmidst the chaos, a chance encounter with a mysterious girl named Lyria awakens the fallen dragon of the stars, who unleashes a roar of revival."

      "description": "It is an unreal, beautiful and precious dream-the beautiful Earth Astoria continent. At its center is the land of the land, the capital city, Landsor, where several races—beasts, elves, demons, and humans—help each other.\nThe main character you woke up was in the nearby plain. The sound of a gentle wind and the smell of fresh flowers. However, only memory is completely lost.\nThe only girl in the strange world who led the puzzled youth was a little girl who played the role of a guide. Furthermore, a hungry swordsman passed by. A kind-hearted wizard girl. A cat beast (Beast) who was going down. Bonds born one after another will keep you connected to the world.\nEven if I didn't know how to get back to memory, I was used to a peaceful life and thought I could live happily. But peaceful times do not last forever. When the shadow of a huge conspiracy plugs into Landsol, the fate of you and the girls starts to move"
